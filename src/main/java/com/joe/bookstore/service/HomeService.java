He dons a suit of armor, renames himself Don Quijote, and sets out on a quest to right wrongs and defend the honor of his lady love, Dulcinea del Toboso. However, his delusions of grandeur and chivalry often lead to comical misadventures and mishaps. The novel is a satirical commentary on the idealism of the chivalric code and the contrast with the reality of 17th century Spain. It has become a classic of Spanish literature and is widely regarded as one of the greatest works of fiction ever written.");
